Description: This repository contains a Python script for evaluating machine learning models using various sampling techniques to address class imbalance. The code utilizes popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and imbalanced-learn.

Features:

Evaluates multiple machine learning models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, K Nearest Neighbors) on a given dataset. Implements different sampling techniques (RandomOverSampling, RandomUnderSampling, SMOTE, NearMiss, SMOTEENN) to handle class imbalance. Displays accuracy results in a formatted table for easy interpretation.
